His poems also explored themes such as love, nature, morality, and social justice.\n\nSome of Du Fu's most famous poems include \"The Old Drunkard,\" \"Qian Wood Carver at Home,\" and \"Autumn Thoughts.\" These poems have been widely studied and admired for centuries, not only in China but also around the world.\n\nDu Fu's legacy extends beyond his own time and place.

His use of imagery, symbolism, and emotional depth in his poems influenced generations of Japanese poets, who sought to capture the beauty and complexity of the natural world.\n\nThe spread of Su Shi's ideas through Buddhist networks and the transmission of Chinese texts into Japan helped to establish a cultural exchange between China and Japan that lasted for centuries. This exchange had a lasting impact on the development of literature and art in both countries, shaping the way writers thought about nature, identity, and the human experience.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Su Shi's poetry was highly prized by Japanese aristocrats during the Heian period (794-1185 CE), who saw his works as a source of inspiration for their own literary pursuits. The study of Chinese literature and poetry became an important part of Japanese education during this time, reflecting the growing interest in Chinese culture among the Japanese elite.\n\nOverall, Su Shi's influence on Chinese and Japanese literature is profound and far-reaching, with his poetry continuing to be studied and admired by readers around the world today.", "gold_ref": " , nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages .

Du Fu's poetry provides a vivid and detailed portrayal of the city's culture, politics, and society during this period, making him one of the most important sources for historians studying the Tang dynasty.\n\nDu Fu's poetry is not only a masterpiece of Chinese literature but also an invaluable historical record that has shed light on many aspects of life in China during the Tang dynasty. His work provides insights into the daily lives of ordinary people, the social hierarchies of the time, and the cultural achievements of the era.\n\nThe title \"poet historian\" is well-deserved, as Du Fu's poetry not only showcases his mastery of language and form but also offers a unique window into China's past.

His poetry often expresses a sense of social critique and calls for reform, but these sentiments are conveyed through a deeply personal and emotive lens rather than through careful calculation or strategic analysis.\n\nDu Fu's commentaries on politics are often infused with his own experiences of poverty, loss, and exile, which gives his critiques an intense emotional resonance. His poetry frequently highlights the struggles of ordinary people under the pressure of imperial rule, as well as the personal costs of serving the court.\n\nIn this sense, Du Fu's political commentary is distinct from that of more traditional or pragmatic thinkers who might have offered advice based on careful calculation and strategic analysis. Instead, Du Fu's writings convey a powerful emotional appeal that continues to resonate with readers to this day.\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that while Du Fu's poetry is often celebrated for its emotional authenticity, his views on politics were not entirely straightforward or consistent. As a poet who lived under the Tang dynasty, he was also deeply aware of the complexities and contradictions of court politics, which can make his commentary all the more nuanced and multifaceted.\n\nOverall, Du Fu's political commentary remains an important part of Chinese literary heritage, offering insights into the human costs of imperial rule and the power of poetry to express social critique and moral urgency.", "gold_ref": " us all do what we are supposed to do \" .

These poets were considered to have achieved a high level of cultural and intellectual sophistication, and their works were often seen as embodying a unique blend of artistic and philosophical insight.\n\nSome notable Chinese poets who were referred to as \"poet sages\" include Du Fu (712-770 CE), Li Bai (701-762 CE), and Lu You (1109-1210 CE).
