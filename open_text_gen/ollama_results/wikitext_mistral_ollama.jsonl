He wrote more than 24,000 poems on various topics, with many pieces reflecting the political, social, and personal experiences of his time.

He often wrote about the struggles of common people during times of political upheaval, showcasing his empathy and understanding of their plight. His works have remained popular in China throughout the centuries, and he is considered one of the \"Four Great Classical Poets\" along with Li Bai, Wang Wei, and Liu Yuxi.\n\nIn addition to his literary achievements, Du Fu's historical significance lies in the way he captured the spirit of the Tang Dynasty through his poetry.

This interpretation emphasizes the universality and relatability of Du Fu's poetry rather than focusing solely on his perceived solipsism.\n\nHere's a quote from Hawkes' \"A Guide to Modern Chinese Literature\" (1987) that supports this idea: \"Du Fu was always prepared to explore the depths of his own emotions, and in doing so he explored the human condition.\" This perspective invites readers to see Du Fu as not only a poet grappling with his personal experiences but also as a universal voice speaking for all humanity.", "gold_ref": " famous compassion in fact includes himself , viewed quite objectively and almost as an afterthought \" .
