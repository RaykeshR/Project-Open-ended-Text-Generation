As they are not as self-seeking as the French, they are more easily persuaded to do things that will help other people. The French are not allowed to be selfish, so are far more easily convinced to do things for other people. This means that the Chinese are more likely to be more generous with charity.\n\nOn May 30, 2012 the World Giving Index reported that in 2011, China's annual giving to charity was more than $3.5 billion, compared with the United States' $4 billion. In 2011 the Chinese philanthropic effort was the third largest in the world, behind the United States and the United Kingdom, according to World Giving's own index of generosity.\n\nThe question remains as to whether the Chinese are making a better-informed and compassionate choice than the Americans. The French are not making a better-informed or more generous choice than the Germans. Yet these two nations have recently been rated as the most generous by the World Giving index.

In the third case, the epithet was interpreted as a term denoting the moral or intellectual virtue of a person who had distinguished himself by an unusual or profound insight into the affairs of mankind.

Unlike most battleships the Ise can carry up to six torpedoes to fire on target at once.\n\nThe Ise is also quite powerful when facing enemy Destroyers, and as of 1.2.1 can carry three torpedoes with one crew.\n\nA popular thing to do in Ise-class is to use torpedo torpedoes to finish off enemy ship at range, and while they do no damage to the target directly they can damage enemy ships or ships adjacent to it. However the best way to use the torpedo is to use it to finish off enemy warships or destroyers.\n\nIse are very powerful and slow to move, but they can out run or outfight most other ships, especially when they are equipped with the Yamato-class torpedoes.\n\nThe following are some of the better ways to use the Ise.\n\nIf the enemy fleet is at point blank range, the Ise can simply ram it.

The Japanese initially made use of civilian-built planes, such as Mitsubishi's P-51 Mustang, Yak-3 Yakovlev D-9 Dive Bomber and Mitsubishi's Ki-46 and Ki-46H Dive Bombers. In early 1943, the U.S. Navy established a series of airfields in Borneo, Sumatra and southern China, in which large numbers of civilian-built U.S. military-surplus airplanes were assembled for the first time. They were used for training by Japanese pilots and as attack planes by the Japanese, and by Allied forces.\n\nIn late 1943, the Japanese began to use the same type of production system in the Philippines where they began to assemble and test \"heavy\" fighters", "len": 256, "nll4tok": [], "ppl": 0.0, "gold_ref": " decided to reinforce the protection of the steering compartment and to create an auxiliary steering compartment .
