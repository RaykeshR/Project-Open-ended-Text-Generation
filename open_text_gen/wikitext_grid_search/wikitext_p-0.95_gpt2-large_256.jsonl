The concept of an author's/text relationship was particularly emphasized by Wensui Ching and Wang Cheng (1869, p. 10), noting that \" it is only after the author has passed through three stages of development that his (or her) life, or his/her thoughts, can be understood and understood as having been formed from the texts\" (quoted in G.A. Cohen, Chinese Studies, vol. 3, p. 853) .\n\nThe concept of \" author/text relationship\" was further elaborated by the Tang dynasty scholar Zhuang Tzu-jen (638-713 CE) and was further refined by the Tang dynasty philosopher Wu Chia-wu (1046-1185 CE). Wu Chia-wu observed that if a work was composed of two authors, one can be said to have a life-and-mind of his/her own (Wu Chia-wu, p. 19).
