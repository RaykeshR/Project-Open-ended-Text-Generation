During the Battle of France the AA fire shifted to air defense of German troops fighting near the Channel. German AA firepower was so good that there was only one major American fighter operation at Normandy where a single aircraft was shot down. In the final day of the invasion no German aircraft was shot down.\n\nAirborne early warning aircraft were flown by American volunteers and USAAF planes. This increased the number of missions flown against the Germans.\n\nThe AA guns had a wide variety of fire control instruments (A and B models). Some used the gunsights and a radar. However, the radar had a hard time of identifying targets over the trees in the woods.\n\nIn 1943 the first American fighter planes of the US Army Air Forces (AAF) arrived in Europe. The first of these were the F-51B Mustang and the A6M Zero in October 1941. The Mustang had a higher-thrust 12,100 lb. thrust (6,850 kg.) turbojet engine. The Zero used a single 12,000 lb. thrust (7,000 kg.) turbojet engine and had a range of 785 miles (1,049 km.).

In their first few months on the island, Ise was taken on the occasional motorcycle tour around the perimeter of the base. The Marine officers on Truk were always ready to help out a new recruit. Ise was always happy to chat and was a natural teacher. On Christmas Eve, they sent him off on his first \"wedding.\" He accompanied the newlywed couple to the local restaurant.

After they finished drinking, they left to their room at the hotel. The next morning, the woman showed up at the base hospital complaining of abdominal pain. Ise was summoned and found that she had suffered a perforation of her stomach that had oozed out several times throughout the night.
