The use of the American Materiel Armament, as well as the use of the American air force as a defensive force, were integral in the formation of the American Armed Forces. The most common modification was the development of the machine guns and artillery during the first year of the war. The first attempt was made by the French to use American weaponry to protect the French garrison from attack, but this did not make the initial successful bombing or bombardment of the landing ground necessary. This was later improved by an air defense doctrine called the Airborne Army Doctrine which allowed the Allies to attack the land forces to protect them. This doctrine was later adopted by the French and later used as the basis for the German air defense doctrine.

Japan was the only nation to withdraw from Japan in 1918 and Japan was in the midst of the biggest economic depression in Japanese history. But, in a land war which has lasted so long, Japan has been in complete control of the Pacific. While some areas were left uninhabited, many towns in Japan were still flourishing and thousands of civilians remained in Japan, which resulted in an economic collapse and a military collapse in Japan's former imperial government. The economic woes in Japan have since caused some Americans to argue that they should have a good explanation for Japanese-Americans who still think that a Great War is on the way in America or America's beloved Republic. This argument seems to have nothing to do with the Great War or the Great Depression or even the wars in Vietnam and Cambodia. The Great War was an existential event that occurred in Japan.
