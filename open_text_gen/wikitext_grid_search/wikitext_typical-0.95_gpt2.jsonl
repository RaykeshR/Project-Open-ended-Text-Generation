His first memoir of his life, ' ' The World to Come ' , was published in 1844. Mr. Macdonald had a strong personal friendship with the great Sir Arthur Cook and, by 1846, had entered into an intimate, mutual trust with him for their writings. At this juncture Sir John Macdonald was also engaged in various diplomatic and military engagements. He had, he believes, gained at least three or four commendations on the part of the British Government. At some of these engagements he was also paid for his services. A book, 'The Work of A Young Man ' , by a former member of his party, was published in 1851. Among the books Mr. Macdonald had with him were two volumes of his favourite books, of two volumes by James Joyce and one by Mr. John A. Macdonald. I shall henceforth mention the memoirs of two of these outstanding historians. He was also the editor of The Cambridge History of India in 1861 and 1862. They were published by the British Government in 1852, and their work was widely acclaimed in English universities and other schools.

In most instances, the waterline was pulled into a small trench and washed through with some kind of special method. The trench was then filled with water from the water line and attached to the concrete core by a steel pipe.\n\n6.17) In these instances, the waterline was not cut out of the concrete surface. The waterline was cut out through a hole in the concrete core and was then attached directly to the concrete core by a metal pipe.\n\n6.18) When the waterline was attached to the concrete core at the time of loading, it was carefully sealed by using a sealed steel plate with a sealant.\n\n6.19) The waterline was cut back to a location of maximum effectiveness in both case of loading and operation. During operation, the concrete core is protected by the protective steel plate so that the area of the concrete core where it is cut back to maximum effectiveness will be as well as the area where the waterline is attached to the concrete core.
